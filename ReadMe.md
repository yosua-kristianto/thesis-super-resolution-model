# Step by step to do Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network
## Implement an image super-resolution technique in TensorFlow

> I'm still not done on doing explanatory journey with this code. Some still taken from the original website. 

This step-by-step approach will be run through the methodology based on this link below
